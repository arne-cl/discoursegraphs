Note to the author: Please add something informative to this README *before*
releasing your software, as `a little documentation goes a long way`_.  Both
README.rst (this file) and NEWS.rst (release notes) will be included in your
package metadata which gets displayed in the PyPI page for your project.

You can take a look at other projects, such as `pyramid's README.txt
<https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/blob/master/README.rst>`_ for some ideas.
