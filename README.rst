DiscourseGraphs
===============

This library enables you to process linguistic corpora with multiple levels
of annotations by:

1. converting the different annotation formats into separate graphs and 
2. merging these graphs into a single multidigraph (based on the common
   tokenization of the annotation layers)

So far, the following formats can be imported and merged:

* `TigerXML`_ (a format for representing tree-like syntax graphs with
  secondary edges)
* RS3 (a format used by `RSTTool`_ to
  annotate documents with Rhetorical Structure Theory)
* an ad-hoc plain text format for annotating expletives (you're probably not
  interested in)
