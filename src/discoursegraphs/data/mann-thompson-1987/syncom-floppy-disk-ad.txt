What if you're having to clean floppy drive heads too often?
Ask for SYNCOM diskettes, with burnished Ectype coating and dust- absorbing jacket liners.
As you floppy drive writes or reads,
a Syncom diskette is working four ways to keep loose particles and dust from causing soft errors, dropouts.
Cleaning agents on the burnished surface of the Ectype coating actually remove build-up from the head,
while lubricating it at the same time.
A carbon additive drains away static electricity
before it can attract dust or lint.
Strong binders hold the signal-carrying oxides tightly within the coating.
And the non-woven jacket liner,
more than just wiping the surface, provides thousands of tiny pockets to keep what it collects.
