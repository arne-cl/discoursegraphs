There is a gardening revolution going on.
People are planting flower baskets with living plants,
mixing many types in one container for a full summer of floral beauty.
To create your own "Victorian" bouquet of flowers,
choose varying shapes, sizes and forms, besides a variety of complementary colors.
Plants that grow tall should be surrounded by smaller ones and filled with others that tumble over the side of a hanging basket.
Leaf textures and colors will also be important.
There is the silver-white foliage of dusty miller, the feathery threads of lotus vine floating down from above, the deep greens, or chartreuse, even the widely varied foliage colors of the coleus.
